- 👀 I’m interested in Data Management. Data Management is composed of the following topics:
-- Data Governance:             The exercise of authority, control and shared decision making (planning, monitoring and enforcement) over the management of data assets.
-- Data Architecture:           Defines the blueprint for managing data assets by aligning with organizational strategy to establish strategic data requirements and designs to meet those requirements.
-- Data Modeling:               The process of discovering, analyzing, representing, and communicating data requirements in a precise form called the data model.
-- Data Storage and Operations: The design, implementation, and support of stored data to maximize value.
-- Data Security:
